# This file will contain all the functions that access and control the database and shall contain some SQL scripts.
# This file will be used by the server.py to access the database. This file shall NOT contain any domain functions
# like sign in or sign up and shall only contain data-centric functionality like find_user(), remove_user(),
# create_post() and etc. Implementing sign_in() in server.py shall involve a call to find_user() implemented in
# database_helper.py .
